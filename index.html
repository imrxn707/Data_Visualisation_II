            <h1>Mapping Malaysia's Foreign Arrivals</h1>
            <h2>An Insight into Foreign Arrivals into Malaysia (2020 - 2023)</h2>
            <p>The global pandemic has drastically altered international travel, and Malaysia saw a
                massive decline in foreign arrivals. As the world recovered, international travels
                are returning, revealing intriguing trends. This visualisation aims to provide a
                comprehensive overview of foreign arrivals into Malaysia between 2020 and 2023.</p>
            <p> What can this data tell us about Malaysia's tourism revival, and what does the future hold for global
                travel?</p>
            <p> Let's explore the story behind the numbers.</p>

            <p>The proportional symbol map illustrates the key points of entry into Malaysia, highlighting where 
                foreign arrivals are most concentrated. The largest symbols on the map represent the busiest 
                entry points, with Bangunan Sultan Iskandar in Johor leading as the top entry location, 
                followed closely by Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and its two terminals.</p>
                <p>Bangunan Sultan Iskandar experiences the highest traffic due to its strategic location 
                    at the Malaysia-Singapore border. Every day, thousands of Malaysians and Singaporeans 
                    cross between the two countries for work, leisure, and trade, making it one of the 
                    busiest land crossings in the world. Meanwhile, KLIA, as the nation’s main international 
                    gateway, naturally handles a vast amount of air traffic, connecting Malaysia to major 
                    global destinations and serving as a key hub for international travelers.</p>

            <p>The chart above depicts the trends in foreign arrivals into Malaysia from 2020 to 2023, 
                seperated by gender. It clearly shows the significant decline in arrivals at the 
                start of 2020, coinciding with the global COVID-19 pandemic. By mid-2020, arrivals had 
                dropped to almost zero due to international travel restrictions and border closures.</p>

                <p>However, starting from early 2022, we see a gradual recovery as Malaysia reopens 
                    its borders and international travel begins to pick up again. The trend shows 
                    consistent growth, with both male and female arrivals increasing steadily. 
                    By late 2023, arrivals reach a stable point, reflecting the normalization of 
                    travel post-pandemic.</p>

            <p>This bar chart shows the number of foreign arrivals into Malaysia, broken down by state. 
                Johor stands out with the highest number of arrivals, far surpassing other states. 
                This is largely due to Johor’s close proximity to Singapore, one of the busiest 
                international land crossings in the world. Many Malaysians and Singaporeans frequently 
                travel between the two countries for work, business, and leisure, contributing to Johor's 
                overwhelming dominance in arrivals.</p>

            <p>Selangor, which includes Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), ranks second in terms 
                of arrivals. As the main international gateway for air travelers into Malaysia, it is 
                a major hub for tourists, business travelers, and international connections.</p>

            <p>States like Sarawak, Pulau Pinang, and Kedah show significantly lower arrival numbers due to 
                smaller international entry points, limited air traffic, and geographical factors. These states
                 also tend to attract more domestic than international tourists, leading to fewer foreign 
                 arrivals compared to Johor and Selangor.</p>
